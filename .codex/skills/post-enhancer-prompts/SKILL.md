# Post Enhancer Prompts

Use these templates when asked to refine social posts, launch copy, private notes, or debug updates.

## Templates

Load `templates.json` and pick template by `id`:
- `thread-crafter`
- `launch-writer`
- `private-notes`
- `debug-brief`

## Usage rule

1. Keep original user intent intact.
2. Apply only one template unless user asks to combine.
3. Output final text only unless user asks for rationale.
